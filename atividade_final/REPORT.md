## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive statistical study on genetic algorithm-based feature selection for multiple linear regression (MLR) applied to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. The research implements Bayesian hyperparameter optimization using Optuna to automatically discover optimal genetic algorithm configurations, coupled with robust statistical analysis through 30 independent executions and bootstrap sampling methodology. The optimized genetic algorithm achieved substantial improvements over baseline MLR, with mean R² values of 0.700 ± 0.075 and 0.735 ± 0.165 for validation and test sets respectively, compared to baseline R² values of 0.403 ± 0.227 and 0.069 ± 0.462. The methodology incorporates bootstrap sampling for baseline variability assessment and demonstrates superior predictive performance with 96.2% fewer features (14.3 ± 3.2 vs 372), establishing a new benchmark for automated feature selection in chemometric applications with rigorous statistical validation.

## I. Introduction

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy generates high-dimensional datasets with hundreds to thousands of spectral variables, presenting significant challenges for multivariate calibration. While this rich spectral information enables detailed chemical analysis, it introduces computational complexity and increases the risk of overfitting, particularly when the number of features approaches or exceeds the sample size.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) remains fundamental in chemometrics due to its computational efficiency and interpretability. However, MLR performance severely degrades with multicollinear or redundant features, making effective feature selection crucial for optimal model performance. Traditional manual approaches to feature selection are time-consuming, subjective, and often suboptimal.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) offer a powerful metaheuristic approach for feature selection, but their effectiveness critically depends on proper hyperparameter configuration. The challenge of hyperparameter tuning has historically limited the practical adoption of genetic algorithms in real-world applications. Recent advances in Bayesian optimization provide promising solutions for automated hyperparameter discovery.

This study addresses these limitations by implementing automated hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, a state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization framework, coupled with rigorous statistical validation through multiple independent executions and bootstrap sampling methodology. This approach enables robust assessment of algorithmic performance variability and provides statistically sound comparisons between methodologies.

## III. Methodology

### A. Dataset Description

The study utilized NIR spectroscopy data from the IDRC 2012 ShootOut competition:

- **Calibration dataset**: 89 samples × 372 spectral features
- **Validation dataset**: 67 samples with IDRC reference values  
- **Test dataset**: Independent evaluation set
- **Wavelength range**: Near-infrared spectral region (specific range not disclosed)

**Data Preprocessing Pipeline**:
1. Missing value imputation using mean strategy
2. Feature standardization via z-score normalization
3. Outlier detection and analysis
4. Correlation structure assessment

### B. Statistical Validation Framework

**Multiple Execution Protocol**:
- **30 independent executions** for each algorithm
- **Bootstrap sampling** for baseline MLR variability assessment
- **Reproducible seeding** for consistent results across runs
- **Complete statistical characterization** of all performance metrics

**Bootstrap Sampling Methodology**:
For baseline MLR, we implemented bootstrap sampling to introduce controlled variability and enable robust statistical analysis:

```python
# Bootstrap sampling for iteration i
np.random.seed(iteration + 42)
n_samples = len(X_train)
bootstrap_indices = np.random.choice(n_samples, size=n_samples, replace=True)
X_train_bootstrap = X_train[bootstrap_indices]
y_train_bootstrap = y_train.iloc[bootstrap_indices]
```

This approach provides:
- **Realistic performance variability assessment**
- **Confidence interval estimation**
- **Robust statistical comparisons**
- **Controlled experimental conditions**

### C. Mathematical Framework

**MLR Constraints**: For mathematical stability, MLR requires:
- Full column rank of design matrix X
- Sample size condition: n > p + 1
- Reasonable condition number: κ(X^T X) < threshold

**Feature Limit Justification**: Given 89 training samples, the theoretical maximum features is 88. To ensure numerical stability and prevent overfitting, we implemented a conservative limit allowing the optimization process to discover the optimal number of features within safe bounds.

### D. Genetic Algorithm Architecture

**Chromosome Representation**:
- Binary encoding: 372-bit vector
- Constraint: Maximum features determined by optimization
- Population initialization: Multi-tier strategy with varying feature densities

```

Where:
- Performance component combines R² and inverse MSE from cross-validation

**Genetic Operators**:
- **Selection**: Tournament selection with configurable tournament size
