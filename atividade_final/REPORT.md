## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive study on genetic algorithm-based feature selection for multiple linear regression (MLR) applied to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. The research implements Bayesian hyperparameter optimization using Optuna to automatically discover optimal genetic algorithm configurations, addressing the critical challenge of manual parameter tuning in evolutionary computation. The optimized genetic algorithm achieved substantial improvements over baseline MLR, with R² values of 0.747 and 0.623 for validation and test sets respectively, compared to baseline R² values of 0.221 and 0.213. The methodology incorporates mathematical constraints limiting feature selection to prevent MLR rank deficiency while maintaining model stability. Through systematic Bayesian optimization, the approach demonstrates superior predictive performance with 86.7% fewer features, establishing a new benchmark for automated feature selection in chemometric applications.

## I. Introduction

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy generates high-dimensional datasets with hundreds to thousands of spectral variables, presenting significant challenges for multivariate calibration. While this rich spectral information enables detailed chemical analysis, it introduces computational complexity and increases the risk of overfitting, particularly when the number of features approaches or exceeds the sample size.

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) remains fundamental in chemometrics due to its computational efficiency and interpretability. However, MLR performance severely degrades with multicollinear or redundant features, making effective feature selection crucial for optimal model performance. Traditional manual approaches to feature selection are time-consuming, subjective, and often suboptimal.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) offer a powerful metaheuristic approach for feature selection, but their effectiveness critically depends on proper hyperparameter configuration. The challenge of hyperparameter tuning has historically limited the practical adoption of genetic algorithms in real-world applications. Recent advances in Bayesian optimization provide promising solutions for automated hyperparameter discovery.

This study addresses these limitations by implementing automated hyperparameter optimization using Optuna, a state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization framework. The methodology incorporates mathematical constraints derived from MLR requirements, ensuring model stability while maximizing predictive performance.

## III. Methodology

### A. Dataset Description

The study utilized NIR spectroscopy data from the IDRC 2012 ShootOut competition:

- **Calibration dataset**: 89 samples × 372 spectral features
- **Validation dataset**: 67 samples with IDRC reference values  
- **Test dataset**: Independent evaluation set
- **Wavelength range**: Near-infrared spectral region (specific range not disclosed)

**Data Preprocessing Pipeline**:
1. Missing value imputation using mean strategy

### B. Mathematical Framework

**MLR Constraints**: For mathematical stability, MLR requires:
- Full column rank of design matrix X
- Sample size condition: n > p + 1
- Reasonable condition number: κ(X^T X) < threshold

**Feature Limit Justification**: Given 89 training samples, the theoretical maximum features is 88. To ensure numerical stability and prevent overfitting, we implemented a conservative limit allowing the optimization process to discover the optimal number of features within safe bounds.

```
