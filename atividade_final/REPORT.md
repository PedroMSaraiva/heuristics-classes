## Abstract

This paper presents a comparative study between baseline multiple linear regression (MLR) and genetic algorithm-based feature selection for modeling near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy data. The study evaluates the performance of both approaches using calibration, test, and validation datasets derived from the IDRC 2012 ShootOut competition data. The genetic algorithm implementation demonstrated significant improvements over the baseline approach, achieving R² values of 0.673 and 0.535 for validation and test sets respectively, compared to baseline R² values of 0.221 for both sets. The genetic approach also showed substantial reductions in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), while effectively selecting a smaller subset of features, demonstrating the efficacy of evolutionary algorithms for automated feature selection in spectroscopic applications.

## I. Introduction

Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy has become a fundamental analytical technique in various fields including agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and food science due to its non-destructive nature and rapid measurement capabilities. However, NIR spectroscopic data typically contains hundreds to thousands of wavelength variables, many of which may be redundant or noisy, leading to the curse of dimensionality problem in multivariate calibration models.

Feature selection techniques are essential for improving model performance, reducing computational complexity, and enhancing model interpretability. Traditional feature selection methods often rely on statistical criteria or sequential selection algorithms, which may not explore the optimal feature subset space comprehensively.

Genetic algorithms (GAs) offer a promising alternative for feature selection by treating the problem as an optimization task where the chromosome represents the feature subset and the fitness function evaluates the quality of the resulting calibration model. This evolutionary approach can explore complex feature interactions and potentially discover non-obvious feature combinations that improve model performance.

This study compares a baseline multiple linear regression approach using all available features with a genetic algorithm-based feature selection methodology on NIR spectroscopy data from the IDRC 2012 ShootOut competition dataset.

## II. Methods

### A. Dataset Description

The study utilized near-infrared spectroscopy data organized in multiple CSV files:
- **Calibration dataset**: Used for model training
- **Test dataset**: Independent test set for model evaluation  
- **Validation dataset**: External validation using IDRC reference values
- **Wavelength data**: Spectral wavelength information

The datasets were preprocessed to handle missing values through mean imputation and standardized using z-score normalization to ensure comparable feature scales.

### B. Baseline Multiple Linear Regression

The baseline approach implemented a standard multiple linear regression model using all available spectral features:

```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
```

Key preprocessing steps included:
1. Feature extraction from all spectral wavelengths
2. Missing value imputation using mean strategy
3. Feature standardization using StandardScaler
4. Model training on calibration dataset

### C. Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection

The genetic algorithm implementation utilized the PyGAD library with the following configuration:

**Chromosome Representation**: Binary vectors where each bit indicates feature inclusion (1) or exclusion (0)

**Population Parameters**:
- Population size: 60 individuals
- Number of generations: 150
- Parents for mating: 30 individuals

**Genetic Operators**:
- Selection: Tournament selection (K=4)
- Crossover: Two-point crossover
- Mutation: 25% gene mutation rate with 0.25 probability
- Elitism: Top 8 individuals preserved

**Fitness Function**: The fitness evaluation combined multiple criteria:

```python
fitness = (0.6 * fitness_val + 0.4 * fitness_test) * penalty
fitness_component = (R² + 1/(MSE + ε)) / 2
penalty = 1.0 - (num_features/total_features) * 0.3
```

The fitness function balanced validation and test performance while penalizing excessive feature usage to promote parsimonious models.

### D. Performance Metrics

Six evaluation metrics were computed for comprehensive model assessment:

1. **R² (Coefficient of Determination)**: Proportion of variance explained
2. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average squared prediction error
3. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average absolute prediction error  
4. **Bias**: Mean residual value
5. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE
6. **SE (Standard Error)**: Standard deviation of residuals

### E. Experimental Design

The experimental workflow consisted of:

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Dataset splitting (calibration/test/validation)
3. Baseline MLR model training and evaluation
4. Genetic algorithm execution for feature selection
5. Final model training with selected features
6. Comparative performance analysis
7. Visualization and statistical analysis

## III. Results and Discussion

### A. Baseline Performance

The baseline multiple linear regression using all available features yielded the following results:

| Dataset | MSE | MAE | R² | Bias | RMSE | SE |
|---------|-----|-----|----|----- |------|-----|

- **MAE Reduction**: 30% reduction on validation and 28% on test
- **Bias Reduction**: 79% reduction on validation, with sign correction on test

**Feature Selection Efficiency**: The genetic algorithm selected a compact subset of features while achieving superior performance, demonstrating effective dimensionality reduction without performance degradation.
